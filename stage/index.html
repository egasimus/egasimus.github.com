The client’s need invariably came a distant second to the need to sell a product, because selling a product is how they get paid.</p><p>That’s why all our advice is independent, impartial and objective.  We have no connections with any product providers and don’t take anything from them.  And our remuneration is based on charging fees for the work we do, so you can always be sure we’re representing you, and no-one else.</p></article></div><div class="column"><article class="article"><h2>Our Vision</h2><p>Our vision is to offer the personal service of a boutique business.

Starting in October 2012, enrolment will be phased dependent on the size of your company, with all enrolled by February 2016. However, even if you do not need to act until later in this time frame, you should not confuse this with the need to prepare now.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>What is auto-enrolment?</h3><p>Auto enrolment will encourage all employees to contribute to a workplace pension scheme in an attempt to move away from a reliance on the State pension. This is not another stakeholder, with fines and sanctions in place for non compliance, employers have a real responsibility to ensure that their employees make adequate provision to their retirement income.</p><p>The Government gauges that between 5 and 8 million people will be newly saving or saving more into workplace pensions as a result. – improving their lives, and reducing the drain on state resources. Your role is to make sure that your company’s approach to pensions meets the new legislation.</p></div><div class="section"><h3>What should you be doing now?</h3><p>For many businesses, this will be the first workplace pension scheme they have operated for their employees, and for others a mix-match approach over the years may see them with multiple pension arrangements that do not meet the new qualifying criteria.</p><p>Either way, burying your head in the sand is not an option and developing the right strategy for implementation will ensure that you are not only compliant with the new legislation, but that auto enrolment has a positive impact on your business and staff.</p><p>We are able to help guide and advise you through this process. Auto Enrolment is not a simple process to set up and there are many different aspects that you need to consider.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div><div id="contact" class="area-grey"><div class="wrapper"><h1>Contact us.</h1><p class="larger">Please telephone <strong class="phone">0123456789</strong>, email us below, or write to:</p><div class="twocol"><div class="column"><address>Cyfeiriad</address></div><div class="column"><form><label for="name">Name:</label><input name="name" placeholder="your name" type="text"><label for="email">Email:</label><input name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" type="email"><label for="message">Message:</label><textarea name="message" placeholder="Add a brief message..." rows="7"></textarea><button type="submit">Send</button></form></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"></div><script src="scripts/include/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script><script src="scripts/include/waypoints.js"></script><script src="scripts/include/waypoints-sticky.js"></script><script src="scripts/include/jquery-scrollto.js"></script><script>$(".header").waypoint('sticky');
